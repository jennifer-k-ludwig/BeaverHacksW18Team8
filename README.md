# MASH
MASH is a game that is intended to predict one's future. This game consists of several categories, each of which represent a part
of a future life, including Home, Partner, Kids, Job, and Salary. The user will be presented with each category, one at a time,
and asked to enter 4 possible outcomes for them. After the user has completed their personalization, they will be given a random 
number and the game will use it to predict their future!

## Usage
Your Home category is preset and you get to fill in the rest

The program works just like the game on paper. One choice is eliminated every x spaces, with x being your random number
