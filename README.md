# MASH
MASH is a game that is intended to predict one's future. This game consists of several categories, each of which represent a part
of a future life, including Home, Partner, Kids, Job, and Salary. The user will be presented with each category, one at a time,
and asked to enter 4 possible outcomes for them. After the user has completed their personalization, they will be given a lucky 
number and the game will predict their future!
